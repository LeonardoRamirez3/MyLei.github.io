								<h2>Your Smile <br />
								</h2>
								<p>Whenever I see your smile, my day gets a lot better, because it reminds me of how lucky I am to be able to make you happy. It's crazy to think about. I, can make the girl of my dreams happy. I can make her smile. Thats the best gift ever. Being able to know that.</p>

								<h2>Small Things are huge for you<br />
								</h2>
								<p>Although sometimes I can't fulfill that, and it pains me to not be able to always, I love the fact that small things are so important to you. I find it incredibly cute when you geek out about small stuff like music or little notes I left in a piece of paper for you, or the white board we have in our locker. I'm sorry I don't do as much stuff, but I know its something that will make you happy, so I will continue trying harder and harder to make that a routine for you.</p>

								<h2>We discover new things together<br />
								</h2>
								<p>I think one of my favorite things that I love doing is discovering new things with you. I can name so many out of the top of my head!! Meghan and Jack, Pokemon Go, Rummikub, the cewl fruit game! We discover movies together and go watch them together like the Super Mario movie. I love the fact that experiences we used to have alone, now we have each other to do them with. I LOVE YOU.</p>

								<h2>We think about our future<br />
								</h2>
								<p>One of the things that we do that excites me the most is talking about our future together, love. I love how we talk about our dream house, where it will be, how it'll look like, how many kids we're gonna have, how many dogs we'll have. I love it all, thinking about a future with you is my favorite pasttime, and I will never stop thinking about it. I will never stop thinking about US.</p>

								<h2>We support each other in the good and bad times<br />
								</h2>
								<p>These past few years have not been easy, in the very least. It could be said that they are the hardest ones we're gonna endure in a VERY, VERY long time. BUT. We did it together. Which means that all those troubles, we backed each other up with them. Throughout the many losses, grief, other circumstances, we always had and have eachother's arms to come home to. We are each other's homes, I will never forget that. Ever.</p>

								<h2>Our Communication<br />
								</h2>
								<p>We have a lot of problems that we have yet to resolve, but thats the thing, we always talk about what is bothering us. From small things that don't have anything with us, to big things that we need to resolve to keep being happy together. I love that we always talk about it. We need to just remember that we are communicating to fix it, not to hurt each other. I adore you my love.</p>

								<h2>You show me love through actions<br />
								</h2>
								<p>I love the way you show me love. It's so pure and it's the sweetest, most adorable, incredibly amazing ways. From small hugs, to holding my arm, making me feel protective of you. I love you day and night. Thank you for showing me your love through notes, kisses, physical touch, gifts as well, trips, everything. Thank you my Lei. My Girl.</p>

								<h2>We do things together<br />
								</h2>
								<p>We always do things together, and while sometimes I believe we can't always do everything together, I really enoy it when we do stuff that we love doing like being couch potatoes, or going out on dates walking around, just spending quality time together. I love it so much and I can't wait when we live together so we can do all of this stuff effortlessly. It's literally one of my biggest dreams ever my love.</p>

								<h2>We have our things<br />
								</h2>
								<p>Okey just stop and think for a second, how many couples have things only they exclusively do, or create? How many couples have Meghan and Jack, or the "God's Watching?" thing we do? We are special, we do things that are special, and I love it with all my heart. We have our songs that remind us of US. We have Disneyland and Disney movies for goodness sake! We have our Christmas Playlist! We do a whole sport together! We have our things, and I love our things as much as I love us :).</p>

								<h2>We always make it work<br />
								</h2>
								<p>No matter how many arguments we have, how many times we're petty, how many times either of us mess up (mostly me but still), we always make it up and we always figure it out. This is us, we mess up, we fight, but we always end up finding an answer. I love us, because at the end of the day, we always have someone to think about. We always have each other, and I hope and pray to God that we will always have each other.</p>

								<h2>The fact that you are my girl<br />
								</h2>
								<p>When I asked you to be my girlfriend, it was the best decision I ever made, really up there with deciding to go to STEAM for engineering to shape my future, even higher than that. I pray to God every single night to help you with all your troubles, to bless you with knowledge and health for you and everyone you love and care about. I pray to him that we fix any troubles we have. I pray to him to help us be happier together. This is something I do because you are a main part of my life and I need you. I hope you feel a similar feeling at least. I LOVE YOU MY LEI, MY WIFE, MY DEAR, MY HONEY, MY SMOOSH, MY BABY MOMMA, MY LIFE. I. LOVE. YOU. ALWAYS.</p>
